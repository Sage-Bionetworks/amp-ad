This will inform the discovery of novel targets and biomarkers being carried out within the <a href=\"/\">AMP-AD</a> and <a href=\"/\">M2OVE-AD</a> Programs. The Resilience-AD Program aims to generate deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which gene-environment interactions lead to cognitively resilient phenotypes in the presence of high risk for disease and identify new therapeutic targets amenable to pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic prevention strategies. The program will:\n<ul>\n<li>Generate dense molecular profiling data (genomic, proteomic, metabolomic) using existing or newly collected biosamples from the rare individuals who resist/escape AD and related dementias despite having high genetic risk (E4 homozygous, Down Syndrome and FAD mutation carriers), individuals who remain dementia-free despite very old age (e.g. 90+, centegenerians), or from individuals who remained cognitively normal despite the presence of disease biomarkers established by neuroimaging or by postmortem neuropathologic assessment.</li>\n<li>Apply network biology approaches to integrate existing or newly generated high-dimensional molecular data from individuals resilient to AD risk with clinical and pathologic data on environmental, lifestyle and experiential factors collected in the same individuals to identify molecular networks predictive of cognitive resilience.</li>\n</ul>\n","attachmentFileHandleIds":[]}
