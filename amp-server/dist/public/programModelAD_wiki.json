MODEL-AD is an interdisciplinary effort funded through the <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/\">National Institute on Aging</a>. \n\nMODEL-AD brings together academic and nonprofit partners to bridge the preclinical to clinical development gap by making data, analytical results and research models available rapidly and broadly for use in therapy development for Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, MODEL-AD will create a pipeline for rigorous preclinical efficacy testing to accelerate the process by which candidate therapeutics can be advanced to human trials. The goals of the program are to:\n<ul>\n<li>Develop the next generation of in vivo Alzheimer’s disease models based on human data</li>\n<li>Institute a standardized and rigorous process for characterization of animal models</li>\n<li>Align the pathophysiological features of Alzheimer’s disease models with corresponding stages of clinical disease using translatable biomarkers</li>\n<li>Establish guidelines for rigorous preclinical testing in animal models</li>\n<li>Ensure rapid availability of animal models, protocols and validation data to all researchers for preclinical drug development</li>\n</ul>\n","attachmentFileHandleIds":[]}
